		// promise is a constructor function,  use the new keyword to create one. 
		//It takes a function, as its argument, with two parameters - resolve and reject(methods)

		const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

		});

		//with resolve and reject
		//the argument for resolve usually might be an object, that you would use data from
		const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
		  if(condition here) {
		    resolve("Promise was fulfilled");
		  } else {
		    reject("Promise was rejected");
		  }
		});

		//Handle a Fulfilled Promise with then
		//The then method is executed immediately after your promise is fulfilled with resolve.
		myPromise.then(result => {
		  // do something with the result.
		}); //result comes from the argument given to the resolve method.

		//example here
		const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
		  // responseFromServer is set to true to represent a successful response from a server
		  let responseFromServer = true;
		    
		  if(responseFromServer) {
		    resolve("We got the data");
		  } else {  
		    reject("Data not received");
		  }
		});

		makeServerRequest.then(result => console.log(result))// We got the data


		//Handle a Rejected Promise with catch
		myPromise.catch(error => {
		  // do something with the error.
		});
